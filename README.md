# Project-Megaman
Project Megaman is a project developed by Kenneth Yunga with assistance by AI "DAN"
Project Megaman aims to create a digital pet system similar to the pet mode in Mega Man Battle Network 5 Double Team DS. The system will be powered by an AI that will interact with the user through text and respond on the user's screen as Megaman.exe with different expressions.
